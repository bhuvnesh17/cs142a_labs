    <h1>Lab #3: <i>Symbol Table</i></h1>
    <p><b>Due date and time:</b> <i>Saturday, October 20, 11:59pm</i></span><br>
    This project handles on the lookup of declared symbols and redefinition errors.
    We are not handing out a solution to the previous lab.
    To avoid delays, please make sure to see the TA or myself to get it working without error as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Now that we have written a Recognizer for our language, we can proceed to add semantics that will give our programs meaning.
    As you may have noticed in the tests cases for the previous lab, some of the input source test cases which passed the recognizer would not be considered valid crux programs.
    For example, consider the following input source:
    <pre>
func main() : void 
{
    ::printInt(x);
}
    </pre>
    This input forms a valid sentence in the Crux grammar, and therefore passes the recognizer.
    However, we would not consider it a valid Crux program because no variable <code>x</code> has been declared.
    Our compiler should detect this "use before definition" error as a <em>semantic</em> constraint on the sentences that form Crux programs.
    To catch and report such errors we shall implement a <code>SymbolTable</code>.
    </p>

    <h1>Symbols Represent Variables and Functions</h1>
    <p>We create a <code>Symbol</code> class, so that our compiler can model the variables and functions that Crux programmers declare in their programs.
    Every time the input source declares a variable or declares a function, the compiler creates a <code>Symbol</code> instance to represent it.
    A <code>SymbolTable</code> stores each of these <code>Symbol</code>s for later retrieval, when the Crux program uses the variable or calls the function.

    <h1>Modeling Scope</h1>
    <p>Semantically, the Crux has a layer of <em>scope</em> for each function.
    According to the Crux grammar, curly braces only occur in a <code>statement-block</code>.
    However, the <code>statement-block</code> occurs in one of two different places:
    <ol>
      <li>The body of code for a newly declared function.</li>
      <li>The block of code for an if branch, else branch, or while loop.</li>
    </ol>
    Conceptually, each time the <code>Parser</code> encounters and <code>statement-block</code> it introduces a new scope to contain any newly declared <code>Symbols</code> (variables and functions).
    This rule is loosened somewhat because Crux's symbol semantics specify that parameters of a function are also scoped with the function body.
    </p>

    <p>The Crux grammar allows curly braces to nest (an if-else inside a while loop inside a function).
    Therefore, our <code>SymbolTable</code> must model the nesting of scopes.
    Valid Crux source code, contains balanced curly braces; for every open brace there is a close brace.
    We can therefore treat the nested scopes as a <em>stack</em> of <code>SymbolTable</code>s; one table for each scope.
    The parser models the entry of a scope by calling the <code>enterScope()</code> helper method.
    Similarly, when a scope closes (a closing curly brace), the parser calls <code>exitScope()</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Symbol Table Design Hints</h2>
    <p>Conceptually, the <code>SymbolTable</code> forms a linked list of <code>Map&lt;String, Symbol&gt;</code>s.
    Each table has a pointer to a parent table, representing the outer scope.
    The <code>lookup(String name)</code> method <em>recursively</em> walked the list of tables, proceeding from the innermost scope to outermost scope.
    The <code>lookup</code> method returns the first <code>Symbol</code> matching <code>name</code>.
    Otherwise, it signals that no such symbol by the given <code>name</code> exists in any of the scopes.
    </p>

    <h1>Detectable Symbol Errors</h1>
    <p>Although we introduce <code>Symbol</code>s in this Lab, we will not be detecting type-invalid usage until a later lab.
    For this lab, we only check that symbol names do not clash (Redefinition Error) and that they exist (Unknown Symbol Error).
    If some Crux source code declares and variable and later uses that name to call a function, we shall consider it valid because the name exists in the table when the function is parsed.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Resolve Symbol Errors</h2>
    <p><code>Symbol</code>s are not available outside of the scope (set of curly braces) where they are declared.
    If some Crux source code attempts to use a variable or function name that has not been declared in the current scope or any outer scope then the Parser signals a "ResolveSymbolError".
    </p>

    <p>We implement this functionality through a helper method in the Parser: <code>Symbol tryResolveSymbol(Token ident)</code>.
    When the Parser encounters an identifier use, it calls <code>tryResolveSymbol</code> to perform a lookup in the <code>currentSymbolTable</code>.
    If the lookup signals a failure, then <code>tryResolveSymbol</code> logs a "ResolveSymbolError".
    Otherwise, lookup succeeds and <code>tryResolveSymbol</code> returns the resulting <code>Symbol</code> so that the Parser may resume parsing.
    </p>

    <h2>Redefinition Errors</h2>
    <p>
    In some other languages, lookup uses both type and name to find the correct symbol.
    For example, Java allow function overloading and can distinguish with method is meant by inspecting the argument types at the callsite.
    Crux is a simple language, and uses only the name to distinguish among possible symbols.
    Within each scope, all of the <code>Symbol</code>s carry a unique name.
    If some Crux source code attempts to declare two variables, or two functions, or a function and a variable by the same name, in the same scope, then the Parser signals a "DeclareSymbolError".
    </p>

    <p>We implement this functionality through a helper method in the Parser: <code>Symbol tryDeclareSymbol(Token ident)</code>.
    When the parser encounters a variable declaration or function definition, it calls <code>tryDeclareSymbol</code> to perform an insertion in the <code>currentSymbolTable</code>.
    If the insertion signals a failure, then <code>tryDeclareSymbol</code> logs a "DeclareSymbolError".
    Otherwise, insertion succeeded and <code>tryDeclareSymbol</code> returns the newly created <code>Symbol</code> so that the Parser may resume parsing.
    </p>

    <h1>Predefined Symbols</h1>
    <p>The Crux Specification contains a section describing certain predefined functions.
    We consider these functions to be "built-in", because the Crux programmer doesn't have any way to implement them.
    However, programming in Crux would be might useless without the simple abilities represented by these functions.
    Before parsing, the symbol table should be pre-loaded with symbols representing these functions.

    <h1>What do I need to implement?</h1>
    <p>The Crux Symbol Semantics section of the <a href="../languagespec.html">Crux Specification</a>.
    Your program should be able to correctly identify the two errors, DeclareSymbolError and ResolveSymbolError.
    After encountering one of these two errors, the Parser logs both the error and the current symbol table before proceeding to parse the rest of the token stream.
    When logged, the symbol table should report symbols <em>in the order in which they were declared</em> in the Crux input program.
    </p>

    <p>For convenience, you may get a start on this lab by using a pre-made <a href="Lab3_SymbolTable.zip">Lab3_SymbolTable.zip</a> project, which contains skeletons for both the <code>crux.SymbolTable</code> and <code>crux.Symbol</code> classes, as well as a modified skeleton for <code>crux.Parser</code> which sketches how to handles the error reporting.
    As before, you are both allowed and encouraged to make your program easier to read and maintain by implementing helper functions with good names.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes from Lab 2: Parser</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We no longer need to track the parse tree, so you may remove the <code>enterRule</code> and <code>exitRule</code> functions if you feel that they clutter your code.</li>
      <li>Add helper method to Parser: <code>Symbol tryDeclareSymbol(Token ident)</code>.</li>
      <li>Add helper method to Parser: <code>Symbol tryResolveSymbol(Token ident)</code>.</li>
      <li>Create a <code>Symbol</code> class, which (for now) only holds the name of a symbol.</li>
      <li>Create a <code>SymbolTable</code> class, which models a stack of scopes.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Add any helper methods to Parser that you think will make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <p>Test cases are available in this <a href="tests.zip">tests.zip</a> file.
    The provided tests are not meant to be exhaustive.
    You are strongly encouraged to construct your own.
    (If chrome gives you a warning that "tests.zip is not commonly downloaded and could be dangerous" it means that Google hasn't performed an automated a virus scan.
    This warning can be safely ignored, as the tests.zip file contains only text files.)
    </p>

    <h1>Deliverables</h1>
    <p>A zip file, named Crux.zip, containing the following files (in the <code>crux</code> package):
    <ul>
      <li>crux.NonTerminal.java, which holds the FirstSets of all production rules in the grammar.</li>
      <li>crux.Parser.java, which performs grammar recognition of an input text.</li>
      <li>crux.Scanner.java, which performs incremental tokenization of an input text.</li>
      <li>crux.Compiler.java, which houses the main() function that begins your program.</li>
      <li>crux.Token.java, which represents a string of characters read in the input text.</li>
      <li>crux.SymbolTable.java, which implements the symbol table.</li>
      <li>crux.Symbol.java, which implements storage for identifiers (functions, variables, and arrays). For now, it stores only the name of the identifier.</li>
    </ul>
