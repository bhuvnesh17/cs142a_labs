    <h1>Lab #2: <i>Parser</i></h1>
    <p><b>Due date and time:</b> <i>Saturday, October 13, 11:59pm</i></span><br>
    We are not handing out a solution to the previous lab.
    To avoid delays, please make sure to see the TA or myself to get it working without error as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Now that we have completed writing a Scanner that tokenizes input Crux source files, we can proceed with implementing the next part of the compiler: a Parser.
    Because our <code>crux.Parser</code> will ultimately do more than task, we split the implementation into smaller pieces.
    </p>

    <p>The grammar given in the <a href="../languagespec.html">Crux Specification</a> describes the appearance of sentences within the Crux language.
    Because Crux is a computer language, some (but not all) of these sentences can be translated into valid Crux programs.
    In this project, we shall implement a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive descent parser</a> for the Crux language.
    The parser will act as a recognizer, allowing us to reject sentences which have syntax errors (invalid or misplaced tokens), because they could not possibly be Crux source code.
    </p>

    <h1>What's Recursive Descent?</h1>
    <p>The Crux language language has been purposefully designed as LL(1) for simplicity of parsing.
    It can be parsed from <b>L</b>eft to right, constructing a <b>L</b>eftmost derivation with only <b>1</b> token of lookahead.
    Remarkably, this feature allows us to directly map each rule in Crux's left-factored grammer with a clause of a recursive procedure.
    During execution of the parse, the Parser will start at the top of the parse tree (rule <code>program</code>) and recursively call itself (<code>program</code> calls <code>declaration_list</code>) descending down through the tree until bottoming out at a terminal (such as those in rule <code>literal</code>).
    </p>

    <a style="float:right" href="ParseTree.png"><img height="120px" src="ParseTree.png" /></a>
    <p>Consider an example sentence in the Crux language:
    <pre>
func main() : int {return 5;}
    </pre>
    The corresponding parse tree is shown to the right (click on it for larger version).
    All of the grammar production rules involved in describing this sentence are present in the tree (shown to the right, click on it for a larger version).
    The <code>crux.Parser</code> calls a method for each one of the parser rules (orange boxes) in the tree.
    For example, the <code>function_declaration</code> method calls the <code>parameter_list</code> method after it has read the <code>FUNC</code>, <code>IDENTIFIER(main)</code>, and <code>OPEN_PAREN</code> tokens.
    </p>

    <p>
    Notice that some of the productions consume none of the tokens.
    The <code>main</code> function in our example has no arguments, so the <code>parameter_list</code> production consumes the empty string, depicted as an empty token-styled box.
    Therefore the <code>parameter_list</code> method must be able to quit and return without accidentally eating the following <code>CLOSE_PAREN</code> token.
    </p>

    <h1>Left-Factoring Removes Infinite Recursion</h1>
    <p>
    Implementing each rule as a mutually recursive method in the parser can lead to accidental infinite loops.
    Consider the following (very tiny) grammar, and pseudo-code implementation:
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr><td>
          <pre>
letter := letter "a" | "a" .
          </pre>
          </td><td>
          <pre>
void letter() {
    switch(currentToken) {
    case /*first choice*/:
        letter();
        eatToken("IDENTIFIER(a)");
    case /*second choice*/:
        eatToken("IDENTIFIER(a)");
    }
}
          </pre>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <p>What happens if the <code>letter</code> method always tries the first choice?
    </p>
    <p>First we call <code>letter</code>, which again calls <code>letter</code> without consuming any tokens of input.
    The second call in turn calls <code>letter</code> without consuming any tokens of input.
    The third call again calls <code>letter</code> without consuming any input.
    And so on, until the Java runtime environment says we made too many calls to <code>letter</code> by throwing a <code>java.lang.StackOverflowError</code>.
    </p>

    <p>This is a contrived example, and shows the problem rather directly.
    In realistic grammars, we may have production rules that double-back on themselves in a mutually recursive fashion.
    For example, it might be a longer chain: <code>expression</code> calls <code>term</code> calls <code>factor</code> calls back to <code>expression</code>.
    We still have to remove the left-recursion in a process known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion">left-factoring</a>, as shown in class.
    </p>

    <h1>FirstSets Allow Predictive Choice</h1>
    <p>Once we have a grammar that allows us to compose a recursive descent parser without worry of infinite loops, we notice that some of the productions have more than one available expansion.
    For example, consider a hypothetical <code>statement</code> rule, and its pseudoccode implementation:
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr><td>
          <pre>
statement := variable-declaration
          | statement-block .
          </pre>
          </td><td>
          <pre>
void letter() {
    switch(currentToken) {
    case ???:
        variable_declaration();
        break;
    case ???:
        statement_block();
        break;
    case default:
        error("couldn't make a choice");
    }
}
          </pre>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <p>What if <code>variable_declaration</code> and <code>statement_block</code> both started with <code>"var"</code>?
    How will the parser be able to decide, from looking just at the <code>currentToken</code> which case it should execute?
    </p>
    <p>We can make sure that there is only one unique branch to execute by computing what's called the <code>FirstSet</code> of each non-terminal production rule.
    The above example happens to be contrived, because when we look at the grammar rules for <code>variable_declaration</code> we see that it may start with either a <code>VAR</code> or <code>ARRAY</code> token, while <code>statement_block</code> always begins with a <code>OPEN_BRACE</code>.
    <code>FirstSet(variable_delaration)</code> shares no common tokens with <code>FirstSet(statement_block)</code>, so the parser is always able to choose uniquely between these two possible paths, with no information other than the <code>currentToken</code>.
    </p>

    <h1>What do I need to implement?</h1>
    <p>The Crux Grammar section of the <a href="../languagespec.html">Crux Specification</a>.
    Your program should be able to read input from the Scanner, parsing the stream of tokens one at a time, and printing the grammar rules executed.
    For simplification purposes, we will not implement error recovery.
    It is expected that your Parser reports the first syntax error (if any) it encounters and quits.
    </p>

    <p>For convenience, you may get a start on this lab by using a pre-made <a href="Lab2_Parser.zip">Lab2_Parser.zip</a> project, which contains a <code>crux.Compiler</code> skeleton for executing a <code>crux.Parser</code>.
    As before, you are both allowed and encouraged to make your program easier to read and maintain by implementing helper functions with good names.
   </p>
 
    <h2>What's Changed Since the Last Lab?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>crux.Compiler.main</code> has been changed to create a Parser, call it's <code>parse</code> method, report the parse tree and any syntax errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Designing the Parser</h1>
    <p>Because the parser has already several tasks to accomplish, it makes sense to first sketch some components of the design.

    <h2>Reading Input</h2>
    <p>The Parser gets it's input from a stream of tokens returned from the Scanner.
    It's not necessary (nor allowed) to look more than one token ahead.
    This means that we need only one field <code>currentToken</code> to store the current position in the token stream.
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes, like when stepping over an <code>OPEN_PAREN</code> this token needs to be consumed.
    The parser need only report a syntax error if the current token happens to be different than the one expected (<code>OPEN_PAREN</code>
    At other times, like when detecting whether the optional <code>ELSE</code> branch is present, the token is only consumed if it matches the one expected.
    Because the else clause is optional, the parser would not report a syntax error if the current token happened to be different.
    Rather, it would consider the <code>if_statement</code> finished, and pick up where it left off (likely <code>statement_list</code>).
    Already, we can see that, depending on the grammar, sometimes the current token should be eaten and the token stream advanced and sometimes not; sometimes an error should be reported and sometimes not.
    </p>

    <p>To support a matrix of possibilities I suggest the following helper functions:
    <table>
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>Advance stream?</th><th>Report Error?</th><th>Purpose?</th></tr>
      <tr><td><code>have</code></td><td>No</td><td>No</td><td>Examine the current token.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>accept</code></td><td>When token matches</td><td>No</td><td>Allow matching tokens to be consumed.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>expect</code></td><td>When token matches</td><td>When token doesn't match</td><td>Report errors on unexpected tokens.</td></tr>
    </table>
    Furthermore, these questions will sometimes be asked not on individual <code>crux.Token.Kind</code>s, but on a collection of them.
    For example, if the Parser has to decide whether there were more statements in a <code>statement_list</code>, it's convenient to call <code>have</code> on the <code>statement</code>'s <code>FirstSet</code>.
    Each of the above three functions should be overloaded to receive either a <code>Token.Kind</code> or a <code>NonTerminal</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Recording the Parse Tree</h2>
    <p>The recursive descent parser has a method for each production rule in the grammar.
    When it parses a sentence, it naturally makes a sequence of methods calls that correspond to a pre-order traversal of the parse tree.
    All that is required in the project, is to record this sequence.
    </p>

    <p>The <code>crux.Parser</code> contains one field and two methods for tracking the sequence of production rules:
<pre>
StringBuffer parseTreeBuffer; A field for storing the sequence of production rules.
void enterRule(NonTerminal);  Called whenever the parser enters a production rule.
void exitRule(NonTerminal);   Called whenever the parser exits a production rule.
String parseTreeReport();     A method to retrieve the production rule sequence.
</pre>

    <h2>Reporting Syntax Errors</h2>
    <p>The <code>crux.Parser</code> contains a method specifically for reporting syntax errors: <code>reportSyntaxError(Token tok)</code>.
    This method produces an easy to read error report, which we should expect to find useful when writing test Crux programs for the full compiler.
    Despite the fact that (in this lab) only one error will be reported, the parser has a <code>StringBuffer errorBuffer</code> field that records errors for later query.

    <h2>Developing FirstSets</h2>
    <p>Each of production rules has associated with it a <code>Set&lt;Token.Kind&gt;</code> which describes the collection of tokens which may begin that clause in the grammar.
    In contrast to terminals (Tokens produced by the Scanner), only the non-terminals (production rules|parser methods) have FirstSets.
    Because the grammar is already established, these sets never change, so a <code>enum NonTerminal</code> is a perfect fit.
    </p>

    <p>Ordinarily, it would be cumbersome to compute, for every rule in the grammar, a FirstSet.
    However, Java has an "anonymous class construction" idiom (with regrettable syntax).
    This feature allows computational construction (at Java compile time) of the FirstSets.
    A contrived snippet (<em>not</em> from the Crux grammar) is given below, to show the convenience and use of the <code>Set.add</code> and <code>Set.addAll</code> methods:
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr><td>
          <pre>
factor := "not" expression
       | designator .
          </pre>
          </td>
          <td>
          <pre>
FACTOR(new HashSet<Token.Kind>() {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    {
        add(Token.Kind.NOT);
        addAll(DESIGNATOR.firstSet);
    }})
          </pre>
          </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    In this example, we must be sure that <code>DESIGNATOR</code> is listed before <code>FACTOR</code>.
    Otherwise, the Java compiler will complain that DESIGNATOR doesn't exist when it tries to run the <code>addAll</code> line in <code>FACTOR</code>.
    </p>

    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <p>Test cases are available in this <a href="tests.zip">tests.zip</a> file.
    The provided tests are not meant to be exhaustive.
    You are strongly encouraged to construct your own.
    (If chrome gives you a warning that "tests.zip is not commonly downloaded and could be dangerous" it means that Google hasn't performed an automated a virus scan.
    This warning can be safely ignored, as the tests.zip file contains only text files.)
    </p>

    <h1>Restrictions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>crux.Parser</code> must read each token, one at a time, only as needed, using the <code>next()</code> method of <code>crux.Scanner</code></li>
      <li>Naming Convention: NonTerminals are all uppercase with an underscore "_" where the production rule has hyphen "-".</li>
      <li>Naming Convention: Parser methods are all lowercase with an underscore "_" where the production rule has hyphen "-".</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Deliverables</h1>
    <p>A zip file, named Crux.zip, containing the following files (in the <code>crux</code> package):
    <ul>
      <li>crux.NonTerminal.java, which holds the FirstSets of all production rules in the grammar.</li>
      <li>crux.Parser.java, which performs grammar recognition of an input text.</li>
      <li>crux.Scanner.java, which performs incremental tokenization of an input text.</li>
      <li>crux.Compiler.java, which houses the main() function that begins your program.</li>
      <li>crux.Token.java, which represents a string of characters read in the input text.</li>
    </ul>
